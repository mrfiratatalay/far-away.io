# ⚛️ State Management in React — Learning Through Collaboration

Welcome to our project focused on one of the core concepts of React: **State Management**.  
This project was built with a passion to deeply understand how state works in real-world React applications.

---

## 👥 Team & Collaboration

This project was collaboratively developed by **Fırat Atalay** and **Ayşe Mandıralı**.  
Our goal was to learn together, experiment with React concepts, and support each other while building something useful for other learners as well.

Through pair programming, knowledge sharing, and structured feedback, we worked together to reinforce our understanding of component-based architecture and state behavior in dynamic UIs.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to understand and apply:

- How to manage **state variables** in functional components
- What **derived state** is, and when to use it effectively
- How **parent-child communication** works via props and lifting state up
- When to use local state vs shared state
- The difference between controlled and uncontrolled components

This project reflects our hands-on exploration of these topics in an interactive and beginner-friendly way.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React.js**: Core frontend framework used to build component-based architecture
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Logic implementation and state manipulation
- **CSS**: Basic styling for clean UI

## 💬 Final Thoughts

This project was not just an opportunity to learn React more deeply — it was also a chance for us to work together, challenge each other, and grow as a team.  
We hope this project helps other learners as well!

Thanks for checking it out!
